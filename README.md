# Project 12: Estimating Market of Used Cars
 
**Objective:** To develop a machine learning model for Rusty Bargain, a used car sales company that is building an app intended to accurately and swiftly predict the market value of used cars.

**Accomplishment:** I needed to develop a model superior to the baseline: a linear regression with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3015 on the validation set. I developed an LGBMRegressor with an RMSE of 1764 on the validation set and a wall time under 10 seconds. Additionally, the LGBMRegressor had an RMSE of 1774 on the test set.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Exploratory data analysis, data encoding and scaling, gradient boosting algorithms (CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBRegressor), wall time optimization, and model performance analysis
